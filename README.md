# Camouflaged Object Detection using SegFormer-B2

This project implements a deep learning-based solution for detecting and segmenting **camouflaged objects** in complex scenes. The model uses **SegFormer-B2**, a transformer-based semantic segmentation architecture, trained on high-quality datasets like **COD10K**. It targets real-world applications in surveillance, defense, wildlife monitoring, and medical imaging.

## 📘 Introduction

Camouflaged Object Detection (COD) aims to identify objects that blend into their surroundings due to similar textures, patterns, or colors. This makes traditional detection methods ineffective. COD is critical in fields like defense, search and rescue, autonomous navigation, and ecology.

This project leverages **SegFormer-B2**, a powerful vision transformer model, to enhance accuracy, generalization, and robustness in detecting camouflaged objects across diverse backgrounds.

## 🧠 Model Architecture

We use **SegFormer-B2**, which combines:
- **MiT-B2 (Mix Vision Transformer)** as encoder for multiscale global context
- A **lightweight MLP decoder** for efficient high-resolution output

Key features:
- Overlapping patch embedding
- Efficient self-attention
- Multiscale hierarchical representation
- Fast and memory-efficient inference
